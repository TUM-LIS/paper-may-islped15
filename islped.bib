	doi = {10.1109/SAMOS.2012.6404190},
	abstract = {A recent approach to deal with the challenges that come along with the shrinking feature size of {CMOS} circuits is probabilistic computing. Those challenges, such as noise or process variations, result in a certain probabilistic behavior of the circuit and its gates. Probabilistic Computing, also referred to as {pCMOS}, does not try to avoid the occurrence of errors, but tries to determine the probability of errors at the output of the circuit, and to limit it to a value that the specific application can tolerate. Past research has shown that probabilistic computing has potential to drastically reduce the power consumption of circuits by scaling the supply voltage of gates to a value where they become non-deterministic, while tolerating a certain amount of probabilistic behavior at the output. Therefore, one main task in the design of {pCMOS} circuits is to determine the error probabilities at the output of the circuit, given a combination of error probabilities at the gates. In earlier work, {pCMOS} circuits have been characterized by memory-consuming and complex analytical calculations or by time-consuming software-based simulations. Hardware-accelerated emulators exist in large numbers, but miss the support of injecting errors with specified probabilities into as many circuit elements the user specifies at the same time. In this paper, we propose an {FPGA-based} fault simulator that allows for fast error probability classification, injection of errors at gate- and {RT-level}, and that is furthermore independent on the target architecture. Moreover, we demonstrate the usefulness of such a simulator by characterizing the probabilistic behavior of two benchmark circuits and reveal their energy-saving capability.},

While Moore's law continues to provide additional transistors, power budgets have begun to prohibit those devices from actually being used. To reduce energy consumption, voltage scaling techniques have proved a popular technique with subthreshold design representing the endpoint of voltage scaling. Although it is extremely energy efficient, subthreshold design has been relegated to niche markets due to its major performance penalties. This paper defines and explores near-threshold computing ({NTC)}, a design space where the supply voltage is approximately equal to the threshold voltage of the transistors. This region retains much of the energy savings of subthreshold operation with more favorable performance and variability characteristics. This makes it applicable to a broad range of power-constrained computing segments from sensors to high performance servers. This paper explores the barriers to the widespread adoption of {NTC} and describes current work aimed at overcoming these obstacles.},

A particularly challenging technical problem, solved in our work, is to extend simultaneously tensor products and matrix multiplication in terms of {ADDs} to non-square matrices. Our {PTM-based} method enables accurate evaluation of reliability for moderately large circuits and can be extended by circuit partitioning. To demonstrate the power of the {PTM} approach, we apply it to several problems in fault-tolerant design and reliability improvement.},

	abstract = {The reduction of {CMOS} structures into the nanometer regime, as well as the high demand for low-power applications, animating to further reduce the supply voltages towards the threshold, results in an increased susceptibility of integrated circuits to soft errors. Hence, circuit reliability has become a major concern in today's {VLSI} design process. A new approach to further support these trends is to relax the reliability requirements of a circuit, while ensuring that the functionality of the circuit remains unaffected, or effects remain unnoticed by the user. To realize such an approach it is necessary to determine the probability of an error at the output of a circuit, given an error probability distribution at the circuits' elements. Purely software-based simulation approaches are unsuitable due to the large simulation times. Hardware-accelerated approaches exist, but lack the ability to inject errors based on probabilities, are slow or have a large area overhead. In this paper we propose a novel approach for {FPGA-based}, probabilistic, circuit fault simulation. The proposed system is a mainly hardware-based, which makes the simulation fast, but also keeps the hardware overhead on the {FPGA} low by exploiting {FPGA} specific features.},

	abstract = {Well over a decade ago, many believed that an engine of growth driving the semiconductor and computing industries---captured nicely by Gordon Mooreâ€™s remarkable prophecy (Mooreâ€™s law)---was speeding towards a dangerous cliff-edge. Ranging from expressions of concern to doomsday scenarios, the exact time when serious hurdles would beset us varied quite a bit---some of the more optimistic warnings giving Mooreâ€™s law until. Needless to say, a lot of people have spent time and effort with great success to find ways for substantially extending the time when we would encounter the dreaded cliff-edge, if not avoiding it altogether. Faced with this issue, we started approaching this in a decidedly different manner---one which suggested falling off the metaphorical cliff as a design choice, but in a controlled way. This resulted in devices that could switch and produce bits that are correct, namely of having the intended value, only with a probabilistic guarantee. As a result, the results could in fact be incorrect. Such devices and associated circuits and computing structures are now broadly referred to as inexact designs, circuits, and architectures. In this article, we will crystallize the essence of inexactness dating back to 2002 through two key principles that we developed: (i) that of admitting error in a design in return for resource savings, and subsequently (ii) making resource investments in the elements of a hardware platform proportional to the value of information they compute. We will also give a broad overview of a range of inexact designs and hardware concepts that our group and other groups around the world have been developing since, based on these two principles. Despite not being deterministically precise, inexact designs can be significantly more efficient in the energy they consume, their speed of execution, and their area needs, which makes them attractive in application contexts that are resilient to error. Significantly, our development of inexactness will be contrasted against the rich backdrop of traditional approaches aimed at realizing reliable computing from unreliable elements, starting with von Neumannâ€™s influential lectures and further developed by Shannon-Weaver and others.},

	abstract = {In nano-domain logic circuits, errors generated are transient in nature and will arise due to the uncertainty or the unreliability of the computing element itself. This type of errors - which we refer to as dynamic errors - are to be distinguished from traditional faults and radiation related errors. Due to these highly likely dynamic errors, it is more appropriate to model nano-domain computing as probabilistic rather than deterministic. We propose a probabilistic error model based on Bayesian networks to estimate this expected output error probability, given dynamic error probabilities in each device since this estimate is crucial for nano-domain circuit designers to be able to compare and rank designs based on the expected output error. We estimate the overall output error probability by comparing the outputs of a dynamic error-encoded model with an ideal logic model. We prove that this probabilistic framework is a compact and minimal representation of the overall effect of dynamic errors in a circuit. We use both exact and approximate Bayesian inference schemes for propagation of probabilities. The exact inference shows better time performance than the state-of-the art by exploiting conditional independencies exhibited in the underlying probabilistic framework. However, exact inference is worst case {NP-hard} and can handle only small circuits. Hence, we use two approximate inference schemes for medium size benchmarks. We demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of these approximate inference schemes by comparing estimated results with logic simulation results. We have performed our experiments on {LGSynth'93} and {ISCAS'85} benchmark circuits. We explore our probabilistic model to calculate: 1) error sensitivity of individual gates in a circuit; 2) compute overall exact error probabilities for small circuits; 3) compute approximate error probabilities for medium sized benchmarks using two stochastic sampling schemes; 4) compare and vet design with resp- - ect to dynamic errors; 5) characterize the input space for desired output characteristics by utilizing the unique backtracking capability of Bayesian networks (inverse problem); and 6) to apply selective redundancy to highly sensitive nodes for error tolerant designs.},

Most of the previous approaches to realizing inexact circuits relied on scaling of circuit parameters (such as supply voltage) taking advantage of an applicationâ€™s error tolerance to achieve the cost and accuracy trade-offs, thus suffering from acute drawbacks of considerable implementation overheads that significantly reduced the gains. In this article, two novel design approaches called Probabilistic Pruning and Probabilistic Logic Minimization are proposed to realize inexact circuits with zero hardware {overhead.Extensive} simulations on various architectures of critical datapath elements demonstrate that each of the techniques can independently achieve normalized gains as large as 2x--9.5x in energy-delay-area product for relative error magnitude as low as 10â€‰âˆ’â€‰4\%--8\% compared to corresponding conventional correct circuits.},

	abstract = {Multiple-antenna systems offer very attractive gains in data rates and transmission reliability. Therefore, they are employed in many modern communication standards. However, the detection and separation of these multiple data streams can be very complex. For tree search based detection methods, a channel preprocessing is mandatory which consists mainly of a {QR} matrix decomposition. We propose a modification of the standard {QR} matrix decomposition which simplifies the tree search while not increasing the complexity of the {QR} decomposition. We present hardware architectures of the original and the modified {QR} decomposition. The resulting {ASIC} implementation in 65nm technology runs at a maximum clock frequency of 370 {MHz} and consumes an area of 0.14mm2. The power consumption at the specified clock frequency of 300 {MHz} is only {6.8mW.}},
